What does twitter think? A tiny little tool to keep you informed on
what twitter thinks about some keywords. You don't need it. But you
want it. (Looks best on Source Code Pro with 10pt font). As it stands
the UI and features are complete. I don't find myself needing anything
more from it, so what remains will probably just be performance 
improvements or codebase cleanups.

Features:

 - Opinionated design.
 - Sparklines (everybody needs some).
 - Sentiment analysis.
 - No colors.
